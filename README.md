# Canfield
 Basic C++ console version of Canfield

This repository contains all the C++ files to compile and run a simplified version of Canfield in your console window. Transfer all the files into a directory and simply run "make", then "./Canfield" to start your game!

Rules:
The goal of Canfield is to create four foundations containing the numbers 1-13 in order. There are also four tableaus that can be used for moving cards around and must be sorted in descending order, although there is no required starting card. There is a reserve stack of cards, from which a card will be pulled and transferred to an empty tableau, if applicable, or can be drawn from at anytime. Finally, the rest of the cards make of the deck, from which yo can pull cards from or turn over the next card.
